## About Me
I am a 3rd year undergraduate student at Dalhousie University completing a neuroscience major. Currently, I am working in the Biosignal Lab under the direction of Dr. Tim Bardouille to study brain activity using non-invasive technologies. The project I am assisting on is a study using OPM MEG to identify well documented neural responses to median nerve stimulation.
