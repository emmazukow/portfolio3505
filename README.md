## Sample of My Data Science and Python Skills

## About Me
I am a 3rd year undergraduate student at Dalhousie University completing a neuroscience major. Currently, I am working in the Biosignal Lab under the direction of Dr. Tim Bardouille to study brain activity using non-invasive technologies. The project I am assisting on is a study using OPM MEG to identify well documented neural responses to median nerve stimulation.

## Describing Data
I am able to use built in Python functions as well as functions of numpy to provide [describing data](DescribingData.html) for a particular data set. In the example provided I am able to find the maximum, minimum, mean, and standard deviation for a data set. These values can be extremely useful when understanding the shape of the data as well as for further calculations. 

## Filtering MEG Data
Through experience in the Biosignal Lab I have learnt how to analyze raw MEG data with an important step as [filtering](Filter.html) the data so that we are only looking at the frequency range of interest. In this example you can see that we are interested in signals between 1-70 Hz with an exclusion of 60 Hz. 

## Creating a panda 
In this example I assigned variables to a unique [panda series](Panda.html) series created from a larger data frame which can then be used for other calculations, such as a t-test. 

## Plotting MEG Data 
Here I have shown how to [plot] MEG data in two seperate ways. The first shows the magnetic field measurements per sensor over time, and the second shows the magnetic field readings for a specific time point topographically. 

## T-Test
In this example I walk through the steps of completing a [t-test](ttest.html) on MEG data to compare the values at the peaks of interest to the baseline values which are the null hypothesis.
