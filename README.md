# Emma Zukow's Portfolio
Sample of My Data Science and Python Skills

## About Me
I am a 3rd year undergraduate student at Dalhousie University completing a neuroscience major. Currently, I am working in the Biosignal Lab under the direction of Dr. Tim Bardouille to study brain activity using non-invasive technologies. The project I am assisting on is a study using OPM MEG to identify well documented neural responses to median nerve stimulation.

## Describing Data
I am able to use built in Python functions as well as functions of numpy to provide [describing data](DescribingData.html) for a particular data set. In the example provided I am able to find the maximum, minimum, mean, and standard deviation for a data set. These values can be extremely useful when understanding the shape of the data as well as for further calculations.
